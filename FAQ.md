##### I'm using appId - why can the proxy not access my private content?

This is by design in the security model for the ArcGIS platform. 
[Applications using appId/appSecret by design](https://developers.arcgis.com/authentication/app-logins.html) don't have permission to search for private content, even if owned by the same person.


##### Where can I get help?

Contact [Esri Support](http://support.esri.com/) or post on the [ArcGIS forums](http://forums.arcgis.com/forums/15-ArcGIS-API-for-JavaScript).
